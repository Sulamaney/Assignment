        <br>
        Comparisons are used to evaluate whether two values are equal, not equal, greater than, less than, etc.<br>
        Common comparison operators include: <br><br>
            Equal to (==) <br>
            Not equal to (!=) <br>
            Greater than (>) <br>
            Less than (<) <br>
            Greater than or equal to (>=) <br>
            Less than or equal to (<=) <br><br>
        Comparisons usually result in a boolean value (true or false) depending on whether the condition is met.

        <p style="text-align: center;">Logical Operators:</p>
        <br>
        Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and evaluate them together. <br>
        Common logical operators include: <br><br>
        AND (&& or 'and' in Python) <br>
        OR (|| or 'or' in Python) <br>
        NOT (! or 'not' in Python) <br><br>
        Logical operators operate on boolean values and produce boolean results. <br><br>
        AND returns true only if both conditions are true. <br>
        OR returns true if at least one condition is true. <br>
        NOT negates the result of the condition.
