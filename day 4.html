    JavaScript, initially named "LiveScript," was developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications Corporation 
    in late 1995. Here's a brief history of JavaScript from its inception (which is often referred to as "Year 0" in this context) 
    up to its sixth year:

    Year 0 (1995):
    JavaScript was introduced by Netscape Communications Corporation as a scripting language for web development.
    It was originally named "LiveScript" but was later renamed "JavaScript" as part of a marketing collaboration between 
    Netscape and Sun Microsystems, leveraging the popularity of Java.
    
    Year 1 (1996):
    Netscape submitted JavaScript to the ECMA International standards organization for standardization.
    ECMA International published the first edition of the ECMAScript standard, officially standardizing JavaScript, 
    with the release of ECMAScript 1 (ES1) in June 1997.
    
    Year 2 (1997):
    Microsoft embraced JavaScript and released its own implementation called JScript, which was largely compatible with JavaScript.
    The rivalry between Netscape and Microsoft led to the "browser wars," during which both companies introduced new features 
    and extensions to their respective implementations of JavaScript, resulting in fragmentation and inconsistencies in the language.
    
    Year 3 (1998):
    ECMAScript 2 (ES2) was released, introducing minor updates and clarifications to the language specification.
    Despite the browser wars, JavaScript became widely adopted as the de facto language for client-side scripting in web browsers, 
    enabling dynamic and interactive web content.
    
    Year 4 (1999):
    Netscape open-sourced its JavaScript engine as part of the Mozilla project, leading to the development of the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine.
    JavaScript continued to evolve, with browser vendors implementing new features and improvements to the language.
    
    Year 5 (2000):
    ECMAScript 3 (ES3) was released, significantly improving the language specification with features such as regular expressions, 
    try/catch exception handling, and better support for object-oriented programming. JavaScript's popularity continued to grow, 
    with the language being used not only for client-side scripting but also for server-side development with technologies 
    like Node.js, which was introduced later. During its first six years, JavaScript underwent rapid development and 
    adoption, evolving from a simple scripting language for web pages to a powerful and versatile programming language used for a wide 
    range of applications, both on the client-side and server-side. Its standardized specification (ECMAScript) played a crucial role 
    in ensuring interoperability and consistency across different implementations and platforms.
