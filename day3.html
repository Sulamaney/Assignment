    public:
    The public keyword is an access modifier used to declare that a method, variable, or class is accessible from any other class. When a method or variable is declared as public, <br>
    it can be accessed by any other class in the same package or even from a different package if the class is imported.
    <br><br>
    static:
    The static keyword is used to declare a method, variable, block, or nested class as belonging to the class rather than to instances of the class. <br>
    It means that the method or variable can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. <br>
    Static methods and variables are shared among all instances of the class and can be accessed using the class name.
    <br><br>
    void:
    The void keyword is used to declare that a method does not return any value. 
    When a method is declared with a return type of void, it means the method performs some actions or tasks but does not produce any result or value. 
    Void methods are commonly used for performing actions such as printing to the console or updating variables without returning a value.
    <br><br>
    final:
    The final keyword is used to declare that a variable, method, or class cannot be modified, overridden, or extended, respectively. <br>
    When applied to a variable, it means the variable's value cannot be changed once it's initialized. When applied to a method,<br> 
    it means the method cannot be overridden by subclasses. When applied to a class, it means the class cannot be subclassed.
    <br><br>
    class:
    The class keyword is used to declare a class in Java. A class is a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior. <br>
    It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have. In Java, every application consists of one or more classes, <br>
    and the class keyword is used to define each class.
