    Java:
        Strongly Typed and Static:
        Java is strongly typed, meaning that variable types must be explicitly declared and adhered to throughout the program.
        It is also static, which means that type checking occurs at compile time.
        Object-Oriented:
        Java follows the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, emphasizing the use of objects and classes.
        It provides features like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
        Platform Independence:
        Java’s Virtual Machine (VM) allows compiled programs to run anywhere, regardless of the platform. This concept is known as “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA).
        Robust and Secure:
        Java’s strict type system and memory management contribute to its robustness.
        It includes features like garbage collection and exception handling for better security.
        Used for Standalone Applications:
        Java creates standalone applications that can run independently.
        Java applets (small applications) are fully contained programs that can be embedded in web pages.
        
    
    JavaScript:
        Weakly Typed and Dynamic:
        JavaScript is weakly typed, allowing more flexibility in variable types.
        It is dynamic, with type checking occurring during runtime.
        Primarily Used for Web Development:
        JavaScript is mainly used for web development.
        It runs in web browsers and interacts with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web pages.
        Event-Driven and Asynchronous:
        JavaScript is event-driven, responding to user actions like clicks and form submissions.
        It supports asynchronous programming using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
        Client-Side Scripting:
        JavaScript executes on the client side (browser).
        It enhances user experience by enabling interactivity and real-time updates.
        Libraries and Frameworks:
        JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of libraries (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) and frameworks (e.g., Node.js) for efficient development.
