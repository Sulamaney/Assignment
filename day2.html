    Java:<br>
        Strongly Typed and Static:<br>
        Java is strongly typed, meaning that variable types must be explicitly declared and adhered to throughout the program.<br>
        It is also static, which means that type checking occurs at compile time.<br><br>
        Object-Oriented:<br>
        Java follows the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, emphasizing the use of objects and classes.<br>
        It provides features like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.<br><br>
        Platform Independence:<br>
        Java’s Virtual Machine (VM) allows compiled programs to run anywhere, regardless of the platform. <br>
        This concept is known as “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA).<br><br>
        Robust and Secure:<br>
        Java’s strict type system and memory management contribute to its robustness.<br>
        It includes features like garbage collection and exception handling for better security.<br><br>
        Used for Standalone Applications:<br>
        Java creates standalone applications that can run independently.<br>
        Java applets (small applications) are fully contained programs that can be embedded in web pages.<br>
        
        <br><br>
    JavaScript:<br>
        Weakly Typed and Dynamic:<br>
        JavaScript is weakly typed, allowing more flexibility in variable types.<br>
        It is dynamic, with type checking occurring during runtime.<br><br>
        Primarily Used for Web Development:<br>
        JavaScript is mainly used for web development.<br>
        It runs in web browsers and interacts with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web pages.<br><br>
        Event-Driven and Asynchronous:<br>
        JavaScript is event-driven, responding to user actions like clicks and form submissions.<br>
        It supports asynchronous programming using callbacks, promises, and async/await.<br><br>
        Client-Side Scripting:<br>
        JavaScript executes on the client side (browser).<br>
        It enhances user experience by enabling interactivity and real-time updates.<br><br>
        Libraries and Frameworks:<br>
        JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of libraries (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) and frameworks (e.g., Node.js) for efficient development.<br>
