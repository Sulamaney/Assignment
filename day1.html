    DIFFERENCE BTW JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT
    <br><br>
    Purpose:<br>
    Java: Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language designed for building standalone applications, <br>
    enterprise-level software, web servers, and Android mobile applications. It's often used for large-scale projects <br>
    and server-side development.<br>
    JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used for front-end web development. It's executed in web <br>
    browsers to add interactivity, dynamic content, and behavior to web pages. JavaScript is also used on the server-side (Node.js) <br>
    for building scalable network applications.<br>
    <br><br>
    Execution Environment:<br>
    Java: Java programs are typically compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). <br>
    This allows Java applications to run on any device or platform that has a compatible JVM installed.<br>
    JavaScript: JavaScript code is executed by web browsers' JavaScript engines, such as V8 in Chrome and SpiderMonkey in Firefox.<br>
    It's also increasingly used on the server-side with platforms like Node.js, where JavaScript code is executed outside of a browser environment.<br>
    <br><br>
    Syntax and Typing:<br>
    Java: Java is a statically-typed language, meaning variable types are explicitly declared and checked at compile time. It follows <br>
    a C-style syntax and requires strict adherence to syntax rules.<br>
    JavaScript: JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, allowing variables to hold values of any type without explicit declaration. <br>
    It follows a C-style syntax similar to Java but has more flexible and forgiving syntax rules.<br>
    <br><br>
    Concurrency:<br>
    Java: Java has built-in support for multithreading and concurrency through features like threads and synchronized methods.<br> 
    This allows developers to create parallel and concurrent programs easily.<br>
    JavaScript: JavaScript is primarily single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one set of instructions at a time. <br>
    However, it supports asynchronous programming through features like callbacks, promises, and async/await, enabling <br>
    non-blocking I/O operations and concurrency.<br>
    <br><br>
    Runtime Environment:<br>
    Java: Java applications require the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) to be installed on the target <br>
    system for execution.<br>
    JavaScript: JavaScript code is executed within web browsers natively or on the server-side with environments like Node.js, <br>
    which provides a runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside of the browser.<br>

    <br><br><br>

    SIMILARITIES BTW JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT
    
    Syntax: <br>
    Both Java and JavaScript have syntax influenced by the C programming language, including curly braces {}, semicolons ;, <br>
    and similar control structures such as loops and conditional statements.<br>
    <br><br>
    Object-Oriented Programming: <br>
    Both languages support object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms. <br>
    They allow the creation of classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. <br>
    However, Java's implementation of OOP is more strict and structured compared to JavaScript.<br>
    <br><br>
    Garbage Collection: <br>
    Both Java and JavaScript feature automatic memory management through garbage collection. <br>
    Developers don't need to manually allocate and deallocate memory, as the runtime environments handle memory management tasks.<br>
    <br><br>
    Community and Ecosystem: <br>
    Both languages have vibrant communities and extensive ecosystems with numerous libraries, frameworks, <br>
    and tools available for development. For Java, popular frameworks include Spring, Hibernate, and Apache Struts, <br>
    while JavaScript has frameworks like React.js, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end development, and Node.js for server-side development.<br>
    <br><br>
    Platform Independence: <br>
    While they achieve it differently, both languages offer platform independence to some extent. <br>
    Java achieves this through its bytecode and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing Java applications to run on any<br>
    platform with a compatible JVM. <br>
    JavaScript achieves platform independence through its execution in web browsers, which are available on various operating systems.<br>
    <br><br>
    Versatility: <br>
    Both Java and JavaScript are versatile languages used in a wide range of applications.<br> 
    Java is used for building desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications (Android), enterprise software, and more.<br> 
    JavaScript is primarily used for web development but can also be used for server-side development (Node.js), <br>
    mobile app development (React Native), desktop application development (Electron), and even IoT (Internet of Things) development.<br>
