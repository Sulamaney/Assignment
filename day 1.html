    DIFFERENCE BTW JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT
    
    Purpose:
    Java: Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language designed for building standalone applications, enterprise-level software, web servers, and Android mobile applications. It's often used for large-scale projects and server-side development.
    JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used for front-end web development. It's executed in web browsers to add interactivity, dynamic content, and behavior to web pages. JavaScript is also used on the server-side (Node.js) for building scalable network applications.
    
    Execution Environment:
    Java: Java programs are typically compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This allows Java applications to run on any device or platform that has a compatible JVM installed.
    JavaScript: JavaScript code is executed by web browsers' JavaScript engines, such as V8 in Chrome and SpiderMonkey in Firefox. It's also increasingly used on the server-side with platforms like Node.js, where JavaScript code is executed outside of a browser environment.
    
    Syntax and Typing:
    Java: Java is a statically-typed language, meaning variable types are explicitly declared and checked at compile time. It follows a C-style syntax and requires strict adherence to syntax rules.
    JavaScript: JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, allowing variables to hold values of any type without explicit declaration. It follows a C-style syntax similar to Java but has more flexible and forgiving syntax rules.
    
    Concurrency:
    Java: Java has built-in support for multithreading and concurrency through features like threads and synchronized methods. This allows developers to create parallel and concurrent programs easily.
    JavaScript: JavaScript is primarily single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one set of instructions at a time. However, it supports asynchronous programming through features like callbacks, promises, and async/await, enabling non-blocking I/O operations and concurrency.
    
    Runtime Environment:
    Java: Java applications require the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) to be installed on the target system for execution.
    JavaScript: JavaScript code is executed within web browsers natively or on the server-side with environments like Node.js, which provides a runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside of the browser.



    SIMILARITIES BTW JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT
    
    Syntax: 
    Both Java and JavaScript have syntax influenced by the C programming language, including curly braces {}, semicolons ;, 
    and similar control structures such as loops and conditional statements.
    
    Object-Oriented Programming: 
    Both languages support object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms. 
    They allow the creation of classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. 
    However, Java's implementation of OOP is more strict and structured compared to JavaScript.
    
    Garbage Collection: 
    Both Java and JavaScript feature automatic memory management through garbage collection. 
    Developers don't need to manually allocate and deallocate memory, as the runtime environments handle memory management tasks.
    
    Community and Ecosystem: 
    Both languages have vibrant communities and extensive ecosystems with numerous libraries, frameworks, 
    and tools available for development. For Java, popular frameworks include Spring, Hibernate, and Apache Struts, 
    while JavaScript has frameworks like React.js, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end development, and Node.js for server-side development.
    
    Platform Independence: 
    While they achieve it differently, both languages offer platform independence to some extent. 
    Java achieves this through its bytecode and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing Java applications to run on any platform with a compatible JVM. 
    JavaScript achieves platform independence through its execution in web browsers, which are available on various operating systems.
    
    Versatility: 
    Both Java and JavaScript are versatile languages used in a wide range of applications. 
    Java is used for building desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications (Android), enterprise software, and more. 
    JavaScript is primarily used for web development but can also be used for server-side development (Node.js), 
    mobile app development (React Native), desktop application development (Electron), and even IoT (Internet of Things) development.
